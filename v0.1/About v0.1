This version was created with the purpose of streamlining the whole process of the service which TopicOverflow wants to provide.

NOTE: This version is intended for MATH 124 and MATH 125 past papers since it is easier to extract metadata about each question from its file name since the 
Department of Mathematics named past papers in these two courses uniformly. For MATH 126 we should probably create a different form of extracting metadata since
the naming conventions of files is different.

What's good:

1. No longer need to preprocess the data, the whole process from dividing a past paper into images, to classifying each image with its metadata has been streamlind
upto adding it to the database. 

2. Time required for topic classification is now next to nothing, the CLIP model was essentially useless and I have gotten rid of it. 

3. This version should essentially help us get it intro production. It no longer has the combined pdf functionality, unfortunately. But instead when the client
request their choice of topical past paper, the SQL function in this version returns the question which were requested. Why is this important to have?
We can capsulate this user data (the topical past paper questions) and then use an API from our DB to the website which will then display the questions to the users. 

What's not good:

1. The whole ML model is fucked and its my fault for not understanding that CLIP is essentially useless for out application, and for use to apply the cosine similarity
function we need to pre-train our own ML model. Upside is that I am learning how to do that and hopefully by next month I should figure out how to CREATE OUR VERY
OWN Convulation Neural Network. This is will be very tough but equally rewarding and intellectualy satisfying. 

If the training our own ML model goes to shit, I also have a back plan of converting all past paper pdfs into LaTeX code which can then be used to read the math
symbols and segragate the questions accordingly.

Best,
